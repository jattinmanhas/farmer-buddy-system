                         <h4 className="singlepostDesc_smHeading">Land and soil</h4>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont">Before starting a farm, it is necessary to assess the size of the site and its accessibility for equipment and workers. Assessment of the condition of the soil is no less critical. Determine the soil type, overall fertility, and actual nutrient content.
                              <br /><br />
                              You can also divide the land into several zones to isolate crops from grazing and limit the access of strangers and neighboring animals to the fields.</p>
                         
                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading" >Which Crop to Plant?</h2>

                         <img className="singlepostDesc_img" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HSKq88j2U54/YUCANjCKY5I/AAAAAAAAGYk/9Nbgo2ch_wUi-meDvZAC9YXxfEqop_xbgCLcBGAsYHQ/s600/Crop.jpg" alt="" />
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont" style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }}>The climate can promote the growth of the crop or, on the contrary, destroy it. So you need to know your region’s environment, the amount of precipitation, and the characteristics of the soil. The success of your crop production venture will depend on these factors.
                              <br /><br />
                              Depending on the weather conditions, you can choose drought-tolerant crops such as millet or sorghum. These crops can also be used as livestock feed. If your area is humid, sugarcane or bananas are good choices.

                              The price of agricultural products is based on domestic supply and demand, depending on the domestic pricing policy. The final consumer price is also influenced by the nature and deficiencies of agricultural markets. The Bureau of Food and Agriculture Policy has released a report that shows crop trends in South Africa for 2018–2027. There are significant changes in field crops in this region.
                              <br /><br />
                              The report shows how soybeans and yellow corn, primarily used for animal feed, are expanding as white corn’s staple food. These changes were due to increased demand for feed grains for herd renewal after a drought and low-profit margins for grain producers.
